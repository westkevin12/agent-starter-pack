The `agent-starter-pack` is a collection of production-ready Generative AI Agent templates built for Google Cloud. <br>
It accelerates development by providing a holistic, production-ready solution, addressing common challenges (Deployment & Operations, Evaluation, Customization, Observability) in building and deploying GenAI agents.

| ‚ö°Ô∏è Launch | üß™ Experiment  | ‚úÖ Deploy | üõ†Ô∏è Customize |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Pre-built agent templates](./agents/) (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent, Live Multimodal API). | [Vertex AI evaluation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview) and an interactive playground. | Production-ready infra with [monitoring, observability](./docs/observability.md), and [CI/CD](./docs/deployment.md) on [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) or [Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview). | Extend and customize templates according to your needs. |

## ‚ö° Get Started in 1 Minute

Ready to build your AI agent? Simply run this command:

```bash
# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Install the agent starter pack
pip install agent-starter-pack

# Create a new agent project
agent-starter-pack create my-awesome-agent
```

**That's it!** You now have a fully functional agent project‚Äîcomplete with backend, frontend, and deployment infrastructure‚Äîready for you to explore and customize.
For more installation options, see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).  You can also [try it in Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fagent-starter-pack%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2Fresources%2Fidx) with zero setup.

 üÜï The starter pack offers full support for Agent Engine, a new fully managed solution to deploy agents. Simply run this command to get started:

```bash
agent-starter-pack create my-agent -d agent_engine -a adk_base
```

*See the [full list of options](docs/cli/create.md) for details.*
